# Predictive_Analysis
This project uses predictive analytics to forecast February 2019 product demand using January sales data from Kaggle. Using Excel, MySQL, and Power BI, I identified trends, calculated reorder points, and prioritized high-revenue items like MacBook Pro Laptops, showcasing the value of data-driven inventory management.

In this predictive analysis project, I addressed the challenge of helping a shop owner optimize re-stocking decisions for February 2019 by analyzing January 2019 sales data. With the dataset collected from Kaggle, I employed Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, formatting, and calculating sales prices, while MySQL was crucial for running SQL queries that extracted key insights, such as total sales, weekly sales trends, demand forecasting, and reorder points. Visualizations created in Power BI, including charts showing sales trends and contribution to revenue, highlighted high-priority products like MacBook Pro Laptops, which drove significant revenue. The project emphasizes how predictive analytics can enhance inventory management by accurately forecasting demand, reducing overstock, and preventing stockouts. By applying advanced analytics and clear visual representation, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to solving inventory challenges, ensuring efficient capital and storage utilization, and improving customer satisfaction through data-driven restocking decisions.
